# Changelog

# Unreleased

- new driver: mbc - a driver to find multibyte comparisons in AVR binaries

# v.0.8.13 - 2021-09-06

- Now supporting Motorola SRecord

- merged pull-request (#68) from pointbazaar (Alexander Hansen)
  - added format reader for motorola hex (SRecord)
  - thanks for that :)

- refactored srec format reader (PR #68)
  - adjusted style
  - fixed some minor bugs

- connected srec format reader to pipeline

- Important: file extension decides which reader will be invoked 
  - *.hex  ==> invokes intel hex reader
  - *.srec ==> invokes srec reader

- added format reader interface (reader/reader.c)
  - reader for different file formats can be now added to reader/format/
    - for example reader/format/ihex.c to read the intel hex format

# v.0.8.12 - 2021-08-10

- reduction of heap usage and overall memory usage
  - only 10 heap allocs needed to disassemble an intel hex file

- getting rid of basic integers in important sections
  - flash address is now represented as uint32_t 
  - opcodes are (finally) represented as uint32_t
  - for more user relevant changes see libvmcu headers

- the disassembly is now sorted (ascending, sorted by address)
  - this change is mandatory for the cfg

- refactored decoder
  - decoder operates now on an intermediate representation (binary_buffer) of the binary

- added vmcu_binary_buffer_t (only for internal usage)
  - this serves as an intermediate representation for the decoder
  - every single format reader (reader/) should return a binary buffer

- refactored intel hex reader

- adjusted example section in README

# v.0.8.11 - 2021-07-07

- added: CFG - control flow graph
  - vmcu_cfg_t is the controlflow graph of libvmcu. It holds,
    - vmcu_cfg_t node*, a dynamic array of vmcu_node_t structures
    - node[0] is the entry node
      - a node consists of
        - vmcu_xref_t xto, a cross-reference to the corresponding instruction (xref-to)
        - vmcu_cfg_node_t *t, a node pointer for the true branch
        - vmcu_cfg_node_t *f, a node pointer for the false branch
    - int32_t used, a simple node counter, should be equal to report.progsize
  
- added: CFG example driver (driver/cfg/)

- using CMake now
- added syntax highlight for stepper driver

# v.0.8.10 - 2021-06-28

    - stack     (true if instr reads/writes stack)
    - io        (true if instr reads/writes io segment)
    - ds        (true if instr reads/writes data segment)
    - sp        (true if instr reads/writes stack pointer)
    - pc        (true if instr reads/writes program counter)

    - t_flag    (true if instr reads/writes t flag)
    - i_flag    (true if instr reads/writes interrupt flag)
    
  - NOTE: Although (stack, io, registers âŠ‚ ds), (stack = true) or (io = true) 
    or (registers = true) does not imply (ds = true).

- Added: annotator stage in pipeline
  - this stage annotates instructions by adding additional information about
    the instruction itself, like groups and explicit/implicit read/write access.

- Added: rwaccess driver (driver/rwaccess/)
- Adjusted drivers, etc.

# v.0.8.9 - 2021-06-22

- VMCU_OP rework
  - rename to VMCU_OPTYPE
  - added new types to enumeration. Enumeration after rework:
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_NONE = -1 (no operand, therefore no type)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_R,        (register operand)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_RP,       (registerpair operand)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_X,        (x pointer operand)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_Y,        (y pointer operand)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_Z,        (z pointer operand)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_B,        (bit number 0-7)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_K4,       (4-bit immediate)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_K6,       (6-bit immediate)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_K8,       (8-bit immediate)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_IO5,      (5-bit I/O address)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_IO6,      (6-bit I/O address)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_D7,       (7-bit data address)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_D16,      (16-bit data address)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_P22,      (22-bit program address)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_S7,       (7-bit signed displacement, program memory)
    - VMCU_OPTYPE_S12       (12-bit signed displacement, program memory)
  - similar types can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR_instruction_set

- Added: VMCU_REGISTER - an enumeration of AVR general purpose registers (r0-r31)
  
- Added: vmcu_registerpair_t structure
  - this structure is able to represent a registerpair by holding
    - a VMCU_REGISTER low - low byte of pair
    - a VMCU_REGISTER high - high byte of pair

- vmcu_operand_t rework
  - vmcu_operand_t now consists of a
    - VMCU_OPTYPE - an enumeration of different operand types
    - value union - a c-union holding different kinds of operand values

- The value union of vmcu_operand_t contains
  - uint8_t k  for type = K4, K6, K8
  - uint8_t b  for type = B
  - uint8_t io for type = IO5, IO6
  - uint16_t d for type = D7, D16
  - uint32_t p for type = P22
  - int16_t s  for type = S7, S12

- disassembled .dw directive (= illegal opcode) does not have its opcode as source operand anymore
  - instead, an illegal opcode (.dw xxxx) has following attributes
    - instr->src.type  = VMCU_OPTYPE_NONE
    - instr->dest.type = VMCU_OPTYPE_NONE
    - therefore no operand values
  - in order to simplify printing these "instructions", I've decided to move the .dw value (xxxx)
    to instr->mnem.base. So the base mnemonic is now ".dw xxxx" with no operands. 

- endloop driver (driver/endloop/) improvement
  - endloop driver is now able to detect unconditional and conditional endless loops

- adjusted driver code

    all instruction-specific details can be accessed
    through an instance of vmcu_xref_t
  - for example: xref->p->mnem, xref->p->addr, etc.
    
  - replaced vmcu_caller_t with vmcu_xref_t

# v.0.7.0 - 2021-02-20

- MDX is now a library for static and dynamic analysis of
  AVR binaries called libvmcu
  
- rename MDX to libvmcu (VMCU)

- removed CLI and debugger from engine
  - debugger will be available in another repository
  
Comment: I don't like working on graphical user interfaces so I've decided
to kick out the GUI, so that I can focus on the interesting part: the engine.

The engine is available as a statically linked library, called libvmcu. It offers
static analysis of AVR source code on assembly level. It is possible to analyze
potential labels and their callers/jumpers, special functions register analysis,
instruction decomposing, and more. Besides that, libvmcu offers dynamic analysis in
the form of cycle accurate realtime simulation of the ATmega328(P) family, including
its peripherals.

  - example: out 0x3f, r1 ; SREG

- Minor refactor of timer8.
- New Debugcommand: xeb - examine EEPROM as bitmap

        - epnl_printer.* (printer for the eeprom panel)
        - rpnl_printer.* (printer for the right panel)
    - functionality stayed the same

- Added credits for the architecture diagram.
- Fixed comments for push/pop mnemonic.

## v.0.5.0 - 2020-12-31

- Added: Analyzer Module.
    - The Analyzer Module consists of multiple (future) submodules.
    - Each submodule will be covering exactly one aspect of static code analysis.
    - Planned submodules:
        - ISR analysis (explore details about ISRs in your code)
        - SFR analysis (annotate addresses which target special function registers)
        - Function analysis (analyse function calls and maybe even their arguments/return-values)
        - many more...
    - The analyzer is a work in progress

- Performance: Reached 17 MHz execution speed. It is now possible to simulate default Arduino in realtime.

- Refactor of toplevel structures
    - table_t class is now only for user-defined entries like breakpoints, etc.
    - system_t class does not contain table_t class anymore.
    - report_t class is the report of the analyzer after decoding and disassembling hexfile.

    - Created _win_properties which holds data related to the window (WINDOW*) state (height, width, y, x)
    - struct _properties extends struct _win_properties (adding page properties)
    - Panels are now initialized by struct _properties*
    - Prompt is now initialized by struct _win_properties* (prompt has no page properties)
    - Right now extending panel_t class has no real benefits, since all individual panels are the same,
    but this will change in the future.

- Statusregister can be read/written now by writing to its dataspace address (0x005f)

ATmega32(L) (and other MCUs) will be included.

## v.0.3.0 - 2020-10-23

- MDX is now supporting whole AVR Instruction-Set. Some few instructions still have no

which are, currently, not supported by MDX.
